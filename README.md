# AddEmUpGame
A simple multiplayer card game where:
 7 players are dealt 5 cards from two 52 card decks, and the winner is the one with the highest score.
 The score for each player is calculated by adding the highest 3 card values for each player, where the
 number cards have their face value, J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13 and A = 11 (not 1).
 In the event of a tie, the scores are recalculated for only the tied players by calculating a "suit score" for
 each player to see if the tie can be broken (it may not).
 Each card is given a score based on its suit, with diamonds = 1, hearts = 2, spades = 3 and clubs
 = 4, and the player's score is the suit value of the playerâ€™s highest card.

To run :
 addemupgame.exe --in input.txt --out output.txt

Input File Structure: 
 The input file will contain 7 rows, one for each player's hand of 5 cards.
 Each row will contain the player's name separated by a colon then a comma separated list of the 5 cards.
 Input is not case-sensitive.
 Spaces can be ignored.
 Each card will consist of the face value and the suit (H = Hearts, S = Spades, C = Clubs and D =
 Diamonds).

 Example: KD = King of Diamonds.
